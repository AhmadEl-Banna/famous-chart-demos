==================

Set-up:

You need to have Node and Bower installed.

1. Clone the repo or download the zip
2. Change into the directory
3. Type "bower install"
4. Start your local server from the root of the repo

TODO:
Need better test data to demo these properly. All the examples need to have support for adding legends and title.  The bar chart example could also be extended to have SVG axes.
